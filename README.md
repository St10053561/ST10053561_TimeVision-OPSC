## Our Features We Added to the Application

### Automatic Time Tracker
The Automatic Time Tracker works in the background without the need for any user interaction or intervention. The Automatic Time Tracker discreetly monitors when employees start and stop working on a project every single day for each project. The Automatic Time Tracker ensures a comprehensive and accurate account of employees' time expenditure on specific projects and tasks.

### Absence Request
The Absence Request feature allows employees to request a form of absence from work for a certain period. They can select the duration of absence by choosing the start and end date of their absence. They can enter the reason for their absence and there is an additional section for entering more information regarding the request for absence if necessary. After submitting the request for absence, their superior can review the request and approve or reject it.
